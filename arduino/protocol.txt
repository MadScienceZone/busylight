The busylight signal hardware communicates with the host PC via USB connection.
On the host side, the device will appear as a generic serial port. Connect to
this port at 9600 baud, and send the following single-byte ASCII commands to
control it:

B	Turn on only the blue light.
G	Turn on only the green light.
R	Turn on only the bottom (#1) red light.
X	Turn off all lights.
Y	Turn on only the yellow light.
2	Turn on only the top (#2) red light.
!	Turn on both red lights at the same time.
#	Alternately flash both red lights.
%	Alternately flash the top (#2) red light and the blue light.
@       Add green strobe until any other command listed above is sent.

Any other characters are silently ignored, so it is safe to add spaces,
newlines, etc. to the output stream if needed.

The device is powered by the same USB cable. Ensure that the USB port can
supply sufficient current for the lights you want to turn on.

The legacy arrangement was:

=====BLUE===== 0
=====RED2===== 1
=====RED1===== 2
====YELLOW==== 3
====GREEN===== 4

Proposed new protocol allows for up to 7 lights of arbitrary colors:
Lights are numbered 0-6:
	Light#	I/O pin	DIN pin	Canonical Color
	0	#10	5	blue
	1	#6	3	red #1
	2	#7	1	red #2
	3	#8	4	yellow
	4	#9	2	green
	5	#14	6
	6	#16	8

Since we don't mandate colors in any positions, we refer to the lights only
by their numbers in these commands. The command letter begins the command. 
Commands which include an arbitrary number of light numbers are terminated
by an escape (hex 1B, represented here by '$'). If a letter is found while waiting
for arguments, the previous command being parsed is abandoned in favor of the new one.

"flash" means to either flash a single light rapidly with 50% duty cycle
or sequence between multiple lights. Our previous alternating effect is a 2-light
flash now, but now you can pick any two lights. If three or more lights are
listed, they are sequenced in the order listed.

"strobe" means to flash one or more lights very briefly with a longer pause
between flashes. You may have a strobe effect going along with a steady or
flashing light.

A steady light will stop a flashing sequence and vice-versa.
Strobes are only stopped by giving an empty list to strobe or
with the X command (which stops everything).
