The busylight signal hardware communicates with the host PC via USB connection.
On the host side, the device will appear as a generic serial port. Connect to
this port at 9600 baud, and send the following single-byte ASCII commands to
control it:

B	Turn on only the blue light.
G	Turn on only the green light.
R	Turn on only the bottom (#1) red light.
X	Turn off all lights.
Y	Turn on only the yellow light.
2	Turn on only the top (#2) red light.
!	Turn on both red lights at the same time.
#	Alternately flash both red lights.
%	Alternately flash the top (#2) red light and the blue light.
@       Add green strobe until any other command listed above is sent.

Any other characters are silently ignored, so it is safe to add spaces,
newlines, etc. to the output stream if needed.

The device is powered by the same USB cable. Ensure that the USB port can
supply sufficient current for the lights you want to turn on.
